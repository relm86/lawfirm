Other areas of the site:
- Main image. It's something they can edit, but it should remain fixed in it's spot based on the design they've selected.
- Logo. It's something they can edit, but it should remain fixed in it's spot based on the design they've selected.
- Footer. Fixed position, but editable. I'm not sure how to manage those links, maybe a textarea with a wysiwyg editor.

The page building service they want to emulate is https://populr.me/ Check it out and look how the widget edit works on roll-over.

The main things to work on now are the widgets, and adding the filter tags. The admin person should be able to add any tag to the non-API widgets. There will be two types of interactions with these tags: admin-selected and user-selected. The admin-selected is controlled by the admin who selects what widgets get shown to what users (like gender). The user-selected tags are available in the front-end area for the users to control (like car color).

Only offer the white color scheme.

Make templates stupid-proof with easy-to-understand widget layout.

Make login page text customizable for each template.
